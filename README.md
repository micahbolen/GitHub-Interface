An interface that allows a user to type a GitHub organization name into a textbox (e.g. 'redjack') and displays a list of linkable public repos for that organization. The interface uses the [GitHub REST API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-organization-repositories) to retrieve the data.
